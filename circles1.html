<p>It all started when I ran across <a
href="http://www.chriscoyne.com/cfdg/">Chris Coyne's Context-Free
Design Grammar</a> &mdash; in particular, <a
href="http://www.chriscoyne.com/cfdg/page3.php">the second
example</a>, which demonstrates a sort of recursive definition of a
square (which may be familiar to anyone who's played with
affine-transform-based fractals enough (e.g., me)) is applied to a
circle, the result being that the tree of successively smaller circles
more or less fills the square.&nbsp; (This is more easily seen than
described, I think.)</p>

<p>Looking at that, I wondered what one might be able to do by,
instead of taking a circle and scaling it down and translating in
various directions and figuring which points belonged inside one of
those many circles, one used a more <!-- hyperlinkme -->
ray-tracing-ish approach: start with the point to be drawn, then scale
it up until it hits the circle.</p>

<p>So I did that, with a <!-- hyperlinkme? --> small C program, but it
looked kind of boring, even with alternating black and white circles
at successive levels of detail so it wouldn't just be a big
solid-colored square.&nbsp; And then it occurred to me to draw an inverted
(that is, inside-out) circle around the outside (conveniently covering
the one fixed point), and:<p>

<p><img src="sc1.png" alt="[Image: sc1.png]" /></p>

<p>What's going on here mathematically, and in the program, looks like this:</p>
<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr>
<td align="right">f(x,y) =</td>
<td align="left">0</td>
<td align="left"><strong>if</strong> x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.08</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="right">=</td>
<td align="left">1</td>
<td align="left"><strong>if</strong> x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> &gt; 1.125</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="right">=</td>
<td align="left">f(2*|x|-1,2*|y|-1)</td>
<td align="left"><strong>otherwise</strong></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>I'm using reflection (absolute value) rather than translation
(modulo) for mapping the four squares onto one while scaling; it's a
little easier to write (both in math and C) and, thanks to symmetry,
there's no difference.&nbsp; The radii of the circles were chosen,
through fairly simple algebra, such that they'd line up a certain way
with the smaller scales; compared to other values I tried that line up
in different ways, I thought these looked nicer.&nbsp; Oh, and for those
who've noticed that that function isn't defined even for all rational
inputs, let alone reals: yes, I know, but it's good enough for
computer floating-point.</p>

<p>A more traditional-graphics way of looking at the process is that
you start at some infinitely small level, draw a grid of infinitely
many black circles and white inverse-circles-clipped-by-a-square, then
go up the the next larger level and repeat.&nbsp; Not very practical, of
course, but useful as a model.</p>
